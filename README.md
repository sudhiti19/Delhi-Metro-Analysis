Metro Network Analysis involves examining the network of metro systems to understand their structure, efficiency, and effectiveness. It typically includes analyzing routes, stations, traffic, connectivity, and other operational aspects.

1. Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.
2. Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.
3. Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
4. Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.
5. Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.
